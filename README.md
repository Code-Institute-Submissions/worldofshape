## **World of Shape**

World of Shape is a website that aims to get the user in shape and lose weight in 30 days! 


This is attained when the user purchase and attends a 30-day excercise program where the user will have access to World of Shapes personal trainers, the training program and mealplans the user chose to purchase. The user is encuraged to take a "before" and "after" picture of themself in order to monitor thier progress. The World of Shape concept has a proven system that can be validated in the testimonial section of the website.

### **Purpose of Project**

World of Shape is build of an existing website that sells weightloss-training programs and mealplans. The aim of my "World of Shape" website is to improve the existing website and ultimately the profitabillity of the business. This is attained by building a more professinal looking website that is a lot more user friendly and more visually appealing.

The purpose of the project was to create a Full Stack Framework Django site and improve:
* the actual website, 
* the user experiance.
* the profitabillity of the business.

### **Functionality of Project**

The appliction uses Django 3 to encourage rapid development, by following a MTV (model-template-view) architecture pattern. I have used the [**separation of concerns**](https://livebook.manning.com/book/code-like-a-pro/chapter-2/) in the application to utilize the Django Framework effectively.

Alongside the Django framework, I have used sqlite in the project's development phase for local testing. Sqlite is a selfcontained highly reliable SQL database engine that features all the normal relational database management. When the project was ready for deployment I switched to Postgres (PostGreSQL) to ensure that any data entered was visible in my deployed Heroku application. Postgres is open source and boosts a fully technical and easy to use Object relational database management system.

The admin user of World of Shape has full access to the Admin dashboard where the admin can **create, read, update and delete** the training programs or mealplans. 
The Admin dashboard is custom made for the World of Shape website. From the Django dashboard the admin can do the CRUD operations in all 6 applocations. 

The 6 applications are:
* Authentication & authorization
* Blog _(not implemented yet, but is fully functional)_
* Checkout
* Meal
* Products
* Users

The project uses Git and GitHub for version controll and is deployed via Heroku. 

All secret variables are stored in an *env.py* filte that is then ignored by the version control with the gitignore file. This is done to ensure that the project integrity is held at a high security standard.

The application uses Stripe as payment method and when testing the payment functionality please make sure to use the [**Stripe test card numbers**](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards). Throughout the development phase of this project I have used:
* Card number: **4242 4242 4242 4242**
* CVV: **Any 3 digit number**
* Card Date: **Any future date**

Please feel free to register a user to fully test the [World of Shape website](ADD HEROKU ADRESS HERE)

World of Shape helps these users to attain this goal by giving them the tools to effectivly reach the goal set by the user.

## **Features**

### **Existing features**

_**Navigation and buttons**:_ 

The navigation consist of a "logged in" navigation and a "guest" navigation. The difference between the two is that when the user is logged in they will be able to reach the "profile" section and the user is also able to add programs and meals to the shopping cart.

There is a navigation row for larger screens and a "hamburger" menu for smaller screens. there is also a navigation bar in the footer.

The idea behind the navigation both from the navigation bar and the different buttons is to direct the user to the correct location so that it is easy for the user to buy the training programs or meals or get the correct information so that they will feel confident and start one of the programs.

The site is constructed so that the user have to do as few clicks as possible to make a purchase, this makes it more likely that the user purchases a product.

On all pages exept "contact" and "Profile" there are buttons for the user to click on to join the program and get directed to a purchase opportunity. 

_**Home** page:_ 

* The **Join Now** button directs the user to the products page where all the training programs are listed. The user can read more or add a program to the shopping cart.
* The **Read More** button in the "training programs" box directs the user to the products page.
* The **Read More** button in the "Weight Loss Analysis" box directs the user to the weight loss page where the user can find out what program suits them best.
* The **Read More** button in the "Healthy Diet Plan" box directs the user to meal page where the meals and dietplans can be purchased. 
* The **Read More** button below About world of Shape directs the user to the About Us page.
* The names of each testimonial is linked to the the testimonials page.
* The **Join Now** button at the bottom of the page directs the user to the products page.

_**About Us** page:_ 

* The **Read More** button directs the user to the text below.
* The **Find Out How It Works Video** link shows the user a pop-up video explaining the World of Shape concept.
* The **Join Now** button directs the user to the products page.
* The **Get Discount** button at the bottom of the page is not linked yet and is left for future implementation.

_**Our Training** and **Our Meals** page:_

This page displays all training program/Meals available for purchase.

* The **Read More** button directs the user to the text below.
* The **Find My Program**Find button directs the user to the "weight loss" page where the user finds the correct program for them. (There is no **Find My Meals** button!)
* The **Read More** button below each program/meal directs the user to the program/meal page where the user can read more about the specific program/meal.
* The **Add To Cart** button puts the chosen program/meal in the shopping cart and the cart navigation in the top navigation bar displays the number of programs/meals in the cart.
* * The **Get Discount** button at the bottom of the page is not linked yet and is left for future implementation.

_**Program** and **Meals** page:_

This page displays an indivicual program/meal available for purchase.

* The **Add To Cart** button at the top and bottom puts the program/meal in the shopping cart and the cart navigation in the top navigation bar displays the number of products/meals in the cart. It redirects the user to the shopping cart so they can checkout and pay for the program/meal.

The user is intentially redirected to the shopping cart because it is most likely that they will only buy one program/meal at a time, so it is better to redirect the user to the checkout rather than back to the homepage or anywhere else.

_**Testimonials** page:_ 

* The **Read More** button directs the user to the text below.
* The names of each testimonial is linked to the the programs page where the user can get started and purchase a program.
* The **Join Now** button at the bottom directs the user to the products page where the user can get started and purchase a program.

_**Contact form**:_ 

From the contact page the user can send an email to World of Shape. After the message is sent the user is informed the the message has been delivered and World of Shape will be in touch soon.

## **Testing**

### **Travis CI - platform**

### **What is CI - Continuous Integration?**

I have used the practice of CI (Continuous Integration), which is the the practice of merging in small code changes frequently - rather than merging in a large change at the end of a development cycle. The goal is to build healthier software by developing and testing in smaller increments. 
As a continuous integration platform, Travis CI supports your development process by automatically building and testing code changes, providing immediate **feedback** on the success of the change. Travis CI can also automate other parts of your development process by managing deployments and notifications.

### **CI Builds and Automation: Building, Testing, Deploying**

When you run a build, Travis CI clones your GitHub repository into a brand-new virtual environment, and carries out a series of tasks to build and test your code. If one or more of those tasks fail, the build is considered **broken**. If none of the tasks fail, the build is considered **passed** and Travis CI can deploy your code to a web server or application host.

### **Bugs**

#### **Chrome webbrowser**
When the site was manually tested there was a bug when I tried to play the video on the home- and aboutpage. The bug was due to settings in default settings in Chrome.

To fix this problem do this:

1. Go to [chrome://flags/](chrome://flags/) in your chrome browser.
2. Search for: **#same-site-by-default-cookies** and change it from "default" to "Enable".
3. Search for: **#cookies-without-same-site-must-be-secure** and change it from "default" to "Enable".

## **Automated Testing** 

### **Coverage**

I have used the package 'coverage' to see how effective my testing is. 
I installed the covarage package with 'pip install coverage' and then I ran 'Coverage' and created a covhtml file.

run with:   coverage run --source='users' manage.py test && coverage report && coverage html
            Go to the htmlcov file and run the index file to get the report.
and:        python manage.py test users
    
**"coverage run --source='users' manage.py test && coverage report && coverage html"**

## Setting up URLs

Steps to set up url patterns and getting it to work!

**Testimonials example**
1)  Create html page - set Codeblock and DOCTYPE
2) Go to Project urls (WorldofShape) and set urlpattern: path('testimonials/', home_views.contact, name='testimonials'),
3) Go to Home/Views: def testimonials(request):
    """ Contact view takes us to our contactpage """
    return render(request, 'home/testimonials.html')
4) Set urlpattern in Home: path('testimonials/', views.testimonials,
         name='testimonials'),  # from contact view
