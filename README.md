## **World of Shape**

World of Shape is a website that aims to get the user in shape and lose weight within 30 days! 


The user purchase and attends a 30-day excercise program where the user will have access to World of Shapes personal trainers, training programs and mealplans the user choose to purchase. The user is encuraged to take a "before" and "after" picture of themself in order to monitor their progress. The World of Shape concept has a proven system that can be validated in the testimonial section of the website.

### **Purpose of Project**

World of Shape is build of an existing website that sells weightloss-training programs and mealplans. The aim of my "World of Shape" website is to improve the existing website and ultimately the profitabillity of the business. This is attained by building a more professinal looking website that is a lot more user friendly and more visually appealing.

The purpose of the project was to create a Full Stack Framework Django site and improve:
* the actual website, 
* the user experiance.
* the profitabillity of the business.

### **Functionality of Project**

The appliction uses Django 3 to encourage rapid development, by following a MTV (model-template-view) architecture pattern. I have used the [**separation of concerns**](https://livebook.manning.com/book/code-like-a-pro/chapter-2/) in the application to utilize the Django Framework effectively.

Alongside the Django framework, I have used SQlite in the project's development phase for local testing. SQlite is a selfcontained highly reliable SQL database engine that features all the normal relational database management. When the project was ready for deployment I switched to Postgres (PostGreSQL) to ensure that any data entered was visible in my deployed Heroku application. PostGreSQL is open source and boosts a fully technical and easy to use Object relational database management system.

The admin user of World of Shape has full access to the Admin dashboard where the admin can **create, read, update and delete** the Training programs, Mealplans, User settings and Checkout orders. 
The Admin dashboard is custom made for the World of Shape website. From the Django dashboard the admin can do the CRUD operations in all 6 applocations. 

The 7 applications are:
* **Worldofshape**
* Cart
* Checkout
* Home
* Meals
* Products
* Users

The project uses Git and GitHub for version controll and is deployed via Heroku. 

All secret variables are stored in an *env.py* file that is then ignored by the version control with the .gitignore file. This is done to ensure that the project integrity is held at a high security standard.

The application uses Stripe as payment method and when testing the payment functionality please make sure to use the [**Stripe test card numbers**](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards). Throughout the development phase of this project I have used, and they can be used to test the production version as well:
* Card number: **4242 4242 4242 4242**
* CVV: **Any 3 digit number**
* Card Date: **Any future date**

Please feel free to [register](https://worldofshape.herokuapp.com/register/) a user to fully test the World of Shape website

You can also [login](https://worldofshape.herokuapp.com/login/) as the testuser:
 * Username: testuser

## **FEATURES**

### **Existing features**

_**Navigation and buttons**:_ 

The navigation consist of a "logged in" navigation and a "guest" navigation. The difference between the two is that when the user is logged in they will be able to reach the "profile" section and the user is also able to add programs and meals to the shopping cart. If a user isnt logged in and adds something to the cart they will be directed to the login page before they are able to checkout and pay for the item.

There is a navigation row for larger screens and a "hamburger" menu for smaller screens. There is also a navigation bar in the footer.

The idea behind the navigation both from the navigation bar, footer and different buttons is to easily direct the user to the correct location so that it is easy for the user to buy the training programs or meals or get the correct information so that they will feel confident and start one of the programs.

The site is constructed so that the user have to do as few clicks as possible to make a purchase, this makes it more likely that the user purchases a product or mealplan.

On all pages except "contact" and "Profile" there are buttons for the user to click on to join the program and get directed to a purchase opportunity. 

_**Home** page:_ 

* The **Join Now** button directs the user to the products page where all the training programs are listed. The user can read more or add a program to the shopping cart.
* The **Read More** button in the "training programs" box directs the user to the products page.
* The **Read More** button in the "Weight Loss Analysis" box directs the user to the weight loss page where the user can find out what program suits them best.

## **TESTING**

I have conducted both manual and automated testing on the website.

### **Automated Testing** 

Automated testing was conducted on each app. I used Djangos [**TestCase**](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/testing/tools/#testcase) and [**SimpleTestCase**](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/testing/tools/#simpletestcase) to test the apps. 

I then used [**Coverage**](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.1/) to see the "coverage" of my tests, I was not able to get 100% on all apps but that is mentioned above in the section: _Features left to implement_.

I ran the tests on my SQlite development database.

**[See](https://github.com/MrBrunotte/worldofshape/blob/master/media/html_images/coverage_report.jpg)** the Coverage report.

### **Responsiveness**

Summary of manual testing of responsivness [see it here](https://github.com/MrBrunotte/worldofshape/blob/master/media/images/manual_testing_responsivness.PNG)

I have used media queries to build a responsive website. I have looked for "natural" breakpoints on my site and these are the best breakpoints for my design:

  * **Hamburger menu break** ~ @media only screen and (max-width: 1190px)
  * **> 1200px** ~ @media only screen and (min-width: 1199px)
  * **992 - 1199px** ~ @media only screen and (min-width: 991px) and (max-width: 1199px)
  * **768 - 991px** ~ @media only screen and (min-width: 767px) and  (max-width: 991px)
  * **575 - 767px** ~ @media only screen and (min-width: 575px) and (max-width: 767px)
  * **< 575px** ~ @media only screen and (max-width: 574px)

I have tested the responsiveness in browsers:

* Firefox and 
* Chrome
  
I have also tested responsivness for portrait and landscape settings.

### **Code Check**

I have ran all my code through differnt validators to make sure that my code is ok and up to date with current code standards.

#### **HTML code**

It is a bit tricky to test the HTML code due to the use of a base.html, templates and jinja. Therefore I created a HTML testing template called **code_testing.html**. I created a base layout and tested it with the Validator and got no errors. I then pasted in the HTML between the "block content" and the "endblock content" from each app template and tested it in the HTML validator.

My [code_testing.html](https://github.com/MrBrunotte/worldofshape/blob/master/media/html_images/code_testing_html.PNG) template

I filtered out **"bad Values"**

[Bad Values](https://github.com/MrBrunotte/worldofshape/blob/master/media/html_images/error_html_filter.PNG)

When the filter was applied all my templates passed the validator.

To validate my HTML code I used: [Validator W3 Org](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)

#### **CSS code**

My CSS code was checked with [Jigsaw W3 Org](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)

I got 96 warnings and they were all warnings about unknown vendor extension. These came with the css code from the template I downloaded so I have ignored them!

Everything else was labeled **"valid CSS information"** by the validator!

#### **Python code**

My Python code was checked with [PEP8 online](http://pep8online.com/)

When testing I have ignored the code result W291 which is an indication of "trailing whitespace".
